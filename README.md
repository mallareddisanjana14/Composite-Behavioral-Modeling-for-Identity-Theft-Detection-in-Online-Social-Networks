# Composite Behavioral Modeling for Identity Theft Detection in Online Social Networks

A machine learning system to detect identity theft in online social networks (OSNs) using an ensemble of SVM, Random Forest, and Decision Tree classifiers. It features admin and user modules for dataset management, real-time behavioral analysis, and theft detection.

## Project Description
This project develops a robust system to combat identity theft in OSNs. It integrates Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Decision Tree classifiers in an ensemble framework for high accuracy. The **Admin module** manages datasets, preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation. The **User module** offers real-time behavioral visualization and theft alerts. Built with Python, Flask, and SQLite, it processes large-scale data efficiently, achieving 99.67% accuracy with Random Forest.

## Key Features
- **Ensemble Learning**: Combines SVM, Random Forest, and Decision Tree for enhanced detection.
- **Admin Module**: Handles dataset upload, preprocessing, and model evaluation with visual analytics.
- **User Module**: Provides real-time behavior graphs and theft detection alerts.
- **Scalability**: Optimized for large OSN datasets.
- **Adaptability**: Evolves with new threats, reducing false positives.
- **User-Friendly**: Intuitive interfaces for admins and users.
