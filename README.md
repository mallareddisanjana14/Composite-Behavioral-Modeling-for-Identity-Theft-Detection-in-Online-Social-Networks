# Composite-Behavioral-Modeling-for-Identity-Theft-Detection-in-Online-Social-Networks
"Composite Behavioral Modeling for Identity Theft Detection in OSNs" uses SVM, Random Forest, and Decision Tree in an ensemble to detect fraud. Admin module manages data; User module visualizes behavior. Built with Python, Flask, SQLite, it achieves 99.67% accuracy. Future plans: deep learning, live deployment.
